# Final Project for IMDM101
In order to run the game, clone this repository and using UnityHub, open up "Project4" folder as a project. 
This game is in it's alpha stage, so bugs are to be expected. 

Notable features of this game is that it explores an alien and eccentric narrative, with Visual Novel aspects and inventory system, 
the logic to combine the two is designed from scratch.

## A video is provided for demonstration purposes. 
It is located in the main folder, and it plays the full game through, including easter eggs and hidden interactions.
